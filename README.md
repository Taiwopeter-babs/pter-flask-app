This simple web app allows a user to create an account, login, create notes and titles, and logout. It utilizes Flask framework, Jinja templating engine, werkzeug Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) in its implementation.

The application was originally built as part of my effort to introduce secondary school students to web development, thus exposing them to global opportunities education has to offer in a technology driven world.

The application is still in development.
