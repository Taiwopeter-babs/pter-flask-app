This blog has been built with flask in it's entirety, save for the delete_note function
in javascript. 
# Caution
1. Please contact me if you intend to fork this repo.

2. Also, i intend to refactor about 90% of the fuctions in views.py and 
   use the built_in flask-form modules.
3. The reason for No. 2 above is due to difficulties i encountered while trying to
   use my custom methods of returning error pages to the user.
